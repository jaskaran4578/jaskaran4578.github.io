        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is renowned for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility. Developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Its syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Python emphasizes code readability and encourages a programming style that uses fewer lines of code, allowing developers to express complex ideas in a simpler, more concise manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python is dynamically typed and uses automatic memory management, making development faster and reducing the complexity often associated with lower-level languages. Additionally, it supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. One of Python's greatest strengths is its extensive standard library, along with a rich ecosystem of third-party packages, which provides solutions to a wide range of problems, from web development to scientific computation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python is also known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, where the standard library provides tools for tasks like file I/O, database interaction, networking, and web services without the need for additional dependencies.

        <p>
            Python's flexibility and ease of use have made it a go-to language for many industries and applications. Here are some of its most common uses:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Web Development: Python is widely used for back-end web development. Frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid simplify the process of building complex web applications. Django, in particular, is known for its "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) philosophy, which speeds up development and reduces redundancy in code. Many popular websites, such as Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest, use Python for their back-end systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data Science: Python is one of the most popular languages for data analysis and visualization. With powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, Python allows data scientists to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. Python is also extensively used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model development, and data cleaning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Python has become a dominant language in the field of machine learning and AI. Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Keras enable developers to build deep learning models, neural networks, and algorithms for predictive analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Python's simplicity allows researchers to focus on model development rather than language complexity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automation and Scripting: Python is a popular choice for automating repetitive tasks. With tools like Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and PyAutoGUI, developers can automate everything from web scraping and browser interactions to file manipulation and software testing. Python's ease of scripting also makes it a common tool for writing small scripts to handle system administration and task automation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scientific Computing: Python is widely used in the scientific and research communities due to libraries like SciPy, NumPy, and SymPy, which provide the tools needed for performing complex mathematical calculations, simulations, and data analysis. Python’s ability to handle large datasets efficiently makes it an indispensable tool for scientific computing. It is used in physics, biology, chemistry, and other scientific fields to model, simulate, and analyze research data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Game Development: While not as common as C++ or C# for high-performance game development, Python still finds its place in this domain through libraries like Pygame. Python is particularly useful for prototyping game mechanics and concepts quickly. Additionally, Python is sometimes used for scripting in game engines, helping to create the logic and rules of a game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automation of Network Operations: Python is widely used for managing and automating network configurations and operations. It has become a key language in the field of network automation, where libraries such as Paramiko, Netmiko, and NAPALM allow network engineers to automate tasks like device configurations, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking: Python is extensively used in the field of cybersecurity. Its simplicity allows for the rapid development of hacking tools and penetration testing scripts. Libraries such as Scapy and PyCryptodome support network analysis and cryptographic functions, while Python’s cross-platform capabilities make it easy to deploy tools across multiple environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Desktop Applications: While not as common as other languages for GUI development, Python is still used to create cross-platform desktop applications using frameworks such as Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy. These frameworks allow developers to build applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
            </li>
            <li>
                Robotics: Python has gained popularity in the robotics field due to its ease of use and integration with other technologies. Python is often used in conjunction with ROS (Robot Operating System) to program robots for tasks like movement, object detection, and interaction with the environment.
