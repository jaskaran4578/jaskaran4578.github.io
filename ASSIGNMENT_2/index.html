        <p>Welcome to the Programming Languages Wiki, where you can learn about some of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world.</p>
        <p>A programming language does not need to be imperative or Turing-complete, but must be executable and so does not include markup languages such as HTML or XML, but does include domain-specific languages such as SQL and its dialects.</p>
        <p>This is an index to some notable programming languages, in current use.</p>

            <a class="section-headings" href="page1(python).html"><h4 id="py">Python</h4></a>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>

        <div class="section-item">
            <a class="section-headings" href="page2(javascript).html"><h4 id="js">JavaScript</h4></a>
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.</p>

        <div class="section-item">
            <a class="section-headings" href="page3(java).html"><h4 id="ja">Java</h4></a>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-item">
            <a class="section-headings" href="page4(c++).html"><h4 id="c">C++</h4></a>
            <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows.</p>
